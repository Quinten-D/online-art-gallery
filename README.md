# online-art-gallery
My vision for a more tasteful online art gallery. This includes features like blurred previews of paintings and non-intrusive site design to provide a serene background for the images. By having the previews slightly blurred people still have some indication what's on the painting but are more inclined to select it and appreciate it on its own, without it being surrounded by a multitude of other images and distractions. Still very much a work in progress.
